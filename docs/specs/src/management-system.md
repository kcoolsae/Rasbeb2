Management system - teacher's view
===
What a teacher can do with the system.

{% include _menu.md %}
* [Contest system](contest-system.html) (pupil's view)
* [Management system](organisers-system.html) (organiser's view)

When first accessing the application from a specific browser you indicate the preferred interface language. 
This language can be changed at any time.

The landing page of teacher contains links/menu items to various parts of the system allowing the actions listed below. 

### Years, classes and pupils

You can
* add/edit class names. (Classes are clustered into years[^1].)
* copy class names from one year to another[^2].
* 'create' pupils and register them in classes. This can (also) be done in bulk by uploading a spreadsheet with the necessary
  information. A sanity check is done on the data being uploaded - e.g., unknown class names, duplicate entries, 
  empty cells, ... are ignored and reported.
* download a spreadsheet of pupil IDs and password - for a class/for the entire school/for the participants in a local event  
* edit pupil information (name, password, gender)

The list of classes per year can also be used as a starting point for other actions on classes or individual pupils, as described below

### Local events

You can
* create a local event by selecting from a list of competitions and corresponding levels 
* register pupils that can participate in a local event. You can register them an entire class
  at the time and edit/update registrations for individual pupils
* open a local event, i.e., start the contest for registered pupils
* close a local event, and make available the marks, correct answers and other feedback to the participants
* delete a pupil's participation[^3]. Should be used with care!

During an event you can
* monitor pupils' progress
* grant grace minutes to a pupil

### Results

You can
* see individual results of pupils - total marks and marks for each question
* download a spreadsheet with the results for an entire class/school/local event

### Other

You can
* change your personal details (name/password)
* register a colleague to the system, if from the same school

#### Footnotes

[^1]: as in the 'classes of 2022-2023' (not: those of the first year secondary school)

[^2]: by a simple cut-and-paste from a line on the page to a text field?

[^3]:
      e.g., when there were serious technical problems during the contest and you want to give a pupil
      a second chance. Also useful for deleting 'mock' students - i.e., yourself taking a peek at the contest questions.
      (We are not entirely sure yet that we will put this functionality in the application. Maybe reserve it 
      for organisers only?)
