Rasbeb 2 Specifications
==

Rasbeb 2 is the new Bebras contest management system that
is currently under development for use in Belgium, hopefully from August 2024 onwards.
You can anonymously try out the student part of the latest version
on the [Belgian Bebras server](https://bebras.ugent.be/) - unfortunately currently only in Dutch and French.

This web page contains the software requirement specifications for that project, 
and some additional (technical) information. These pages are not entirely up to date, because we
changed some of the specifications while we were programming the new system.

Rasbeb 2 is largely inspired on the older system (Rasbeb 1). By now most of the software
for the student's and teacher's view is already written - some work needs still to be done for
th organiser's view.

### Functionality

* [Contest system](contest-system.html) A description of what the system looks like to a contestant. Will
  be very similar to that of Rasbeb 1 (but a bit 'revamped') which you can try out anonymously
  on the [Belgian Bebras server](https://bebras.ugent.be) - only in Dutch and French, but you will get the gist of it.
* [Management system](management-system.html) - teacher's view.
* Management system - organiser's view. **TODO**
