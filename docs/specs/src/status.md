## Contest status

The status of a contest and/or a local event determine what
the various users may or may not do for that contest. Possibilities are

For the teacher:
* Set up an event for the contest.
* Look at the questions and/or answers of a contest
* Manage an event (open / close)

For the pupils:
* Take part in an event or contest
* See the results of a participation (and the correct answers)

Which of these actions is allowed, depends on the contest type

_Public_ contests have status either _pending_ or _open_ 
* Nothing can be done if the status is _pending_
* Otherwise anonymous participation is allowed and results can be viewed. Questions/answers
  can be viewed by the teacher. Events for public contests are not allowed.

_Restricted_ contests have status either
_pending_, _published_ or _open_
* Nothing can be done if the status is _pending_
* If _published_, corresponding events can be organised, but
  these events cannot be _opened_. Questions/answers are not yet available
  to the teachers. (In practice this status is not often used.)
* If _open_, all actions are allowed in principle, but may be restricted by
  the status of associated events

_Official_ contests have status either _pending_, _published_, _open_ or _closed_
* Nothing can be done if the status is _pending_
* If _published_, corresponding events can be organised, but
  these events cannot be _opened_. Questions/answers are not yet available
  to the teachers
* If _open_, corresponding events can be managed, questions are
  available to the teachers but not yet the answers. Although participation is possible, 
  results are not yet available to pupils.
* If _closed_, results become available to pupils and questions/answers are
  visible to teachers. Local events can no longer be managed (they act as 'closed')
  and new local events can no longer be created.

The only way an event for an official contest can be run after it was closed, is by
duplicating it as a restricted contest.

_Local events_ can be either _pending_, _open_ or _closed_.
* Nothing can be done if the status is _pending_
* When _open_ (and when also the corresponding contest is _open_), registered pupils can participate in this event.
* When _closed_ pupils can obtain their results, provided the following holds
   * The associated contest is _restricted_ and _open_
   * The associated contest is _official_ and _closed_
