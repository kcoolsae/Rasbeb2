Announcing Rasbeb 2 (August 2023)
===

{% include _menu.md %}

---

(This announcement was made in August 2023 - by now most of the software 
for students and teachers has already been rewritten - still some work needs to be done for
th organiser view.)

For the past 10 years Belgium has been running *Rasbeb* 
with great succes as its contest management software for the Bebras challenge. 
For various reasons - see [Why upgrade](why-upgrade.html) - we are now
on the verge of rewriting that software.

As the lead developer of _Rasbeb 2_ I would like to take this opportunity to make an offer (and maybe ask for a little help?).

I offer free use of the Rasbeb 2 software to other countries, especially (but not exclusively) those that are in a similar situation
as ours (i.e., little money, few people, not hundreds of thousands of participants, ...). I am prepared to make small changes and/or additions to cater
to your specific needs and can help setting up the system on your server.  (See also disclaimer below.) 

The software will be open source. The specifications are available at [https://rasbeb2.ugent.be/](https://rasbeb2.ugent.be/).
The old version (student side) can be tried out anonymously at [https://bebras.ugent.be/](https://rasbeb2.ugent.be/) - unfortunately currently
only in Dutch and French. 

We plan to have Rasbeb 2 finished in time for the November 2024 challenge, with test versions available in the beginning of 2024. 

For now, I manage writing and maintaining this software on my own (occasionally supported
by a student). This is however not viable in the long run. Rasbeb would benefit a lot from having 
a development team of size greater than one, preferably based in more than one country. So if you want to use Rasbeb
and can also spare some development time, that would be very much appreciated. Maybe Rasbeb development could even be integrated into some kind
of student project?

I welcome input from other developers. Even if you cannot spare the time
to look at the full specs, any comment would be useful
on what to avoid and how to get certain details precisely correct. E.g, I have little experience
with interactive questions (which were not available in Rasbeb 1).

### Disclaimer

This offer only applies to the Rasbeb **software**. I cannot provide you with server space, I
will not help configure contest details in the application, translate or upload tasks to the system, serve
as a help desk for your teachers and students, ... In short, you can use our
software on your own server, but you remain responsible for every other aspect of organizing
the Bebras contest in your country. (I will try to iron out any bugs that turn up.)
