Management system - organiser's view
===
What an organiser can do with the system. (**TODO** specify in more detail)

{% include _menu.md %}
* [Contest system](contest-system.html) (pupil's view)
* [Management system](organisers-system.html) (organiser's view)

* Add/edit/upload questions
* Organise questions into competitions, i.e., decide which questions to use at what level and indicate
  their difficulty level. Being able to upload a spreadsheet with this information would be nice.
* Change competition status. Make a duplicate of an official contest as a restricted contest
* Add/edit schools
* Add/edit years
* Register teachers
* Mimic a teacher. You get the same functionality as if you were logged in with that teacher's ID and password
* Download statistical information about a competition and its results
