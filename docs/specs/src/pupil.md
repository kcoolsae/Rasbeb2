A pupil's personal page
===
{% include _menu.md %}

---
A pupil's landing page (after login) contains 
* a list of all local events in which they
are allowed to participate (usually not more than one) 
* a list of all local events in which they have participated
that year[^1].

For each of the latter -  provided they are already closed - the pupil can obtain their marks, review the questions and
the answers they have given, and read the feedback page.

For more details, see
* [Contest system](contest-system.html)

### Nice-to-haves
* For a competition in which they participated, pupils can see their position within their
class/school? And a bar chart with the marks for their entire class?

### Removed
* Like any other user, a pupil could change their password and e-mail address. 

  {:.new}
  The e-mail address of a pupil is no longer stored. Passwords of a pupil can only be reset by a teacher. 

* Pupils obtained a 'Bebras ID' which remained the same over the years, even if they switched classes or schools.

  It turns out that in practice this was never used. It also slightly complicates pupil registration by the teachers.
One of the reasons for using this was to track pupils' progress over the years. But as this was not consistently used,
it was never possible to draw any relevant statistics from this.

* Pupil's preferred interface language is not stored in the database but rather in a cookie

#### Footnotes

[^1]: Or more correctly: under that ID. As in Rasbeb 2 pupils get a new ID every year, this amounts to the same essentially.
