(We first describe how an anonymous contest is perceived by the user. The differences with restricted and official
contests will be discussed after that.)

The home page of the application contains a list of public quizzes. After an anonymous user selects one
of these contest they are directed to a
web page with a 'start' button and some additional information. Pressing the button brings them to the competition proper and
makes the clock tick. (During the competition the time that remains is displayed on the screen.)

At the start, the contestant is presented with the first question. Answering a question
brings them automatically to the next question. Moreover, at any time they can skip a question or
return to an earlier one, change their answers or even remove answers (as wrong answers
cost marks while blank answers do not).

There is a button which the user presses to indicate that they are finished. The contest also ends
automatically when the time limit expires. In both cases the (anonymous) user then receives their marks, 
may review their answers and read the corresponding feedback pages.

The official contest runs in much the same way, except that the results (and feedback) are only
available when the competition is officially closed (by the organisers). Moreover, the competition
can only be taken when it is officially opened by the organisers.
Restricted contests function in a similar way, but now the teacher[^1] is fully in charge. The teacher
decides when the competition can be taken and when marks and feedback will be available.

Teachers organise participation in official and restricted competitions by setting up so-called
*local events*[^2].
* A *local event* is associated to an official or a restricted contest which provides
  the corresponding *question sets* (one for each level and language)
* There may be several *local events* on separate days, in separate rooms, ...
* Classes and individual pupils must be registered for a particular local event to be able
  to participate in a competition. They can take part in at most one local event for a given competition - although they
  may be registered for more than one.

The system keeps track of what local event a pupil participated in. It is the local event that determines whether a feedback page
can be made available or not. (Except for an anonymous pupil.)

### Comments

Instead of organising separate subsequent local events, a school may choose to regard the competition as
  a _single_ local event and intermittently close and reopen that event.

This is to be discouraged. One disadvantage is that when a local event is reopened, feedback pages are no longer available
to the pupils that already participated in that event.

#### Footnotes

[^1]:
     Or rather the _school_, as all teachers of the same school have the same privileges regarding pupils,
     classes and local events organised by that school.

[^2]: Called local 'competitions' or 'contests' in Rasbeb 1. 'Events' is probably less confusing.
