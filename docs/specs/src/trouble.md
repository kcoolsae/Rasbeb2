In case of trouble

{% include _menu.md %}

We only support minimal recovery in case of errors.
When a single PC fails, we provide the following:
* {:.new} A pupil can move to a different PC and pick up where he left off on that first PC.
* {:.new} A teacher can grant _grace minutes_ to an individual, to a class or to everyone that is taking part
  in a particular local event (during that event)

### Nice-to-haves

* A teacher can delete a participation and in that way give a pupil a second chance to retake a contest.

The same result can also be obtained by registering the pupil anew, i.e., as a 'new' pupil with the same name but different ID.
However, that new pupil must then also be registered with a class and with a local event, which takes some time.

### Comment

Other problems that have arisen in the past:
* A (translation of a) question was found to be incorrectly formulated during the first day of the competition. Pupils
  that had already participated were given full marks for that question, unless they had left their answer blank. This
  was done by direct manipulation of the database.

  Should the application have a user interface for this kind of actions?
